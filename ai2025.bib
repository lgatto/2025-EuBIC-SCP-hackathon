               stem cells (iPSCs), iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, and adult
               cardiomyocytes. Over 700 proteins could be simultaneously
               measured in each cell revealing unique subpopulations. A sub-set
               of iPSCs expressed higher levels of Lin28a and Tra-1-60 towards
               the outer edge of cell colonies. In the cardiomyocytes, two
               distinct populations were found that exhibited complementary
               metabolic profiles. Cardiomyocytes from iPSCs showed a glycolysis
               profile while adult cardiomyocytes were enriched in proteins
               involved with fatty acid metabolism. Interestingly, rare single
               cells also co-expressed markers of both cardiac and neuronal
               lineages, suggesting there maybe a novel hybrid cell type in the
               human heart.",

        abstract = {Analysing mass spectrometry (MS)-based single-cell
                  proteomics (SCP) data is challenging. The data
                  analysis must address numerous problems that are
                  inherent to both MS-based proteomics technologies
                  and single-cell experiments. This has led to the
                  development of complex and divergent data processing
                  workflows within the field. In this work, we present
                  scplainer, a principled and standardised approach
                  for extracting meaningful insights from SCP
                  data. The approach relies on minimal data processing
                  combined with linear modelling. The approach is a
                  simple yet powerful approach for exploring and
                  interpreting various types of SCP data. scplainer
                  performs variance analysis, differential abundance
                  analysis and component analysis while streamlining
                  the visualization of the results. This thorough
                  exploration enhances our capacity to gain a deeper
                  understanding of the biological processes hidden in
                  the data. Finally, we demonstrate that scplainer
                  corrects for technical variability, and even enables
                  the integration of data sets from different SCP
                  experiments. The approach effectively generates
                  high-quality data that are amenable to perform
                  downstream analyses. In conclusion, this work
                  reshapes the analysis of SCP data by moving efforts
                  from dealing with the technical aspects of data
                  analysis to focusing on answering biologically
                  relevant questions.Competing Interest StatementThe
