* Improving SCP data, software and documentation

Mass spectrometry-based single-cell proteomics (SCP) has become a
credible player in the single-cell biology arena. Continuous technical
improvements have pushed the boundaries of sensitivity and
throughput. However, the computational efforts to support the analysis
of these complex data have been lagging. The [[https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures][QFeatures]] and [[https://uclouvain-cbio.github.io/scp/][scp]]
R/Bioconductor packages are a flexible tools to handle such data. It
allows to process the quantitative data, filtering and/or imputing
missing values, correct batch effects, aggregate features, perform
quality control and, most importantly, offers flexible and efficient
support for robust and interpretable [[https://uclouvain-cbio.github.io/scp/articles/scp_data_modelling.html][statistical modelling]].

In this hackathon, we propose to benefit from the broadest community
input to extend the =scp= ecosystem to make it more accessible to a
growing SCP user base.

*Plan*: Introduction - Existing packages - Possible projects - Expected
skills - Installation instructions - Credit.

* Single cell proteomics

- Mass spectrometry-based single cell proteomics (SCP).
- Many flavours: label-free or labelled, DIA or DDA.
- Focus on the computational aspects of SCP, /conceptually/ applicable
  to all/most these flavours.
- Formatted and curated data readily available.

* Existing packages

- =QFeatures=
- =scp=
- =scpdata=

** =QFeatures=

The =QFeatures= infrastructure enables the management and processing
of quantitative features for high-throughput mass spectrometry assays.
It provides a familiar Bioconductor user experience to manages
quantitative data across different assay levels (such as spectra,
peptides and proteins) in a coherent and tractable format.

- https://bioconductor.org/packages/QFeatures
- https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures

[[file:./figs/qfeatures.png]]

** =scp=

Utility functions for manipulating, processing, and analyzing mass
spectrometry-based single-cell proteomics data. The package is an
extension to the =QFeatures= package and relies on
=SingleCellExpirement= to enable single-cell proteomics analyses.

** =scpdata=

Curated SCP data collection, as =QFeatures= objects.
