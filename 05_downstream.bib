  abstract  = "UNLABELLED: Unsupervised class discovery is a highly useful
               technique in cancer research, where intrinsic groups sharing
               biological characteristics may exist but are unknown. The
               consensus clustering (CC) method provides quantitative and
               visual stability evidence for estimating the number of
               unsupervised classes in a dataset. ConsensusClusterPlus
               implements the CC method in R and extends it with new
               functionality and visualizations including item tracking,
               item-consensus and cluster-consensus plots. These new features
               provide users with detailed information that enable more
               specific decisions in unsupervised class discovery.
               AVAILABILITY: ConsensusClusterPlus is open source software,
               written in R, under GPL-2, and available through the
               Bioconductor project (http://www.bioconductor.org/).

               precision medicine using clustering algorithms. A common problem
               in this area is selection of the number of clusters (K). The
               Monti consensus clustering algorithm is a widely used method
               which uses stability selection to estimate K. However, the
               method has bias towards higher values of K and yields high
               numbers of false positives. As a solution, we developed Monte
               Carlo reference-based consensus clustering (M3C), which is based
               on this algorithm. M3C simulates null distributions of stability
               scores for a range of K values thus enabling a comparison with
               real data to remove bias and statistically test for the presence
               of structure. M3C corrects the inherent bias of consensus
               clustering as demonstrated on simulated and real expression data
               from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For testing M3C, we
               developed clusterlab, a new method for simulating multivariate

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is actively
               embracing quantitative, single-cell level analyses. Indeed,
               recent advances in sample preparation and mass spectrometry (MS)
               have enabled the emergence of quantitative MS-based single-cell
               proteomics (SCP). While exciting and promising, SCP still has
               many rough edges. The current analysis workflows are custom and
               built from scratch. The field is therefore craving for
               standardized software that promotes principled and reproducible
               SCP data analyses. AREAS COVERED: This special report is the
               first step toward the formalization and standardization of SCP
               data analysis. scp, the software that accompanies this work,
               successfully replicates one of the landmark SCP studies and is
               applicable to other experiments and designs. We created a
               repository containing the replicated workflow with comprehensive
               documentation in order to favor further dissemination and
               improvements of SCP data analyses. EXPERT OPINION: Replicating
               SCP data analyses uncovers important challenges in SCP data
               analysis. We describe two such challenges in detail: batch
               correction and data missingness. We provide the current
               state-of-the-art and illustrate the associated limitations. We
               also highlight the intimate dependence that exists between batch
               effects and data missingness and offer avenues for dealing with
               these exciting challenges.",

  abstract = "The heart is characterized by a remarkable degree of
              heterogeneity. Since different cardiac pathologies affect
              different cardiac regions, it is important to understand
              molecular mechanisms by which these parts respond to pathological
              stimuli. In addition to already described left ventricular
              (LV)/right ventricular (RV) and transmural differences, possible
              baso-apical heterogeneity has to be taken into consideration. The
              aim of our study has been, therefore, to compare proteomes in the
              apical and basal parts of the rat RV and LV. Two-dimensional
              electrophoresis was used for the proteomic analysis. The major
              result of this study has revealed for the first time significant
              baso-apical differences in concentration of several proteins,
              both in the LV and RV. As far as the LV is concerned, five
              proteins had higher concentration in the apical compared to basal
              part of the ventricle. Three of them are mitochondrial and belong
              to the ``metabolism and energy pathways'' (myofibrillar creatine
              kinase M-type, L-lactate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoamide
              dehydrogenase). Myosin light chain 3 is a contractile protein and
              HSP60 belongs to heat shock proteins. In the RV, higher
              concentration in the apical part was observed in two
              mitochondrial proteins (creatine kinase S-type and proton pumping
              NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase). The described changes were more
              pronounced in the LV, which is subjected to higher workload.
              However, in both chambers was the concentration of proteins
              markedly higher in the apical than that in basal part, which
              corresponds to the higher energetic demand and contractile
              activity of these segments of both ventricles.",

               Suleiman, M-Saadeh",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Cardiac diseases (e.g. coronary and valve) are
               associated with ventricular cellular remodeling. However,
               ventricular biopsies from left and right ventricles from
               patients with different pathologies are rare and thus little is
               known about disease-induced cellular remodeling in both sides of
               the heart and between different diseases. We hypothesized that
               the protein expression profiles between right and left
               ventricles of patients with aortic valve stenosis (AVS) and
               patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are different and
               that the protein profile is different between the two diseases.
               Left and right ventricular biopsies were collected from patients
               with either CAD or AVS. The biopsies were processed for
               proteomic analysis using isobaric tandem mass tagging and
               analyzed by reverse phase nano-LC-MS/MS. Western blot for
               selected proteins showed strong correlation with proteomic
               analysis. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis between ventricles of the
               same disease (intra-disease) and between ventricles of different
               diseases (inter-disease) identified more than 500 proteins
               detected in all relevant ventricular biopsies. Comparison
               between ventricles and disease state was focused on proteins
               with relatively high fold ($\pm$1.2 fold difference) and
               significant (P < 0.05) differences. Intra-disease protein
               expression differences between left and right ventricles were
               largely structural for AVS patients and largely
               signaling/metabolism for CAD. Proteins commonly associated with
               hypertrophy were also different in the AVS group but with lower
               fold difference. Inter-disease differences between left
               ventricles of AVS and CAD were detected in 9 proteins. However,
               inter-disease differences between the right ventricles of CAD
               and AVS patients were associated with differences in 73
               proteins. The majority of proteins which had a significant
               difference in one ventricle compared to the other pathology also
               had a similar trend in the adjacent ventricle. CONCLUSIONS: This
               work demonstrates for the first time that left and right
               ventricles have a different proteome and that the difference is
               dependent on the type of disease. Inter-disease differential
               expression was more prominent for right ventricles. The finding
               that a protein change in one ventricle was often associated with
               a similar trend in the adjacent ventricle for a large number of
               proteins suggests cross-talk proteome remodeling between
               adjacent ventricles.",
